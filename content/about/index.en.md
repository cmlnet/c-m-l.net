Hello, my name is Christian Humm and this is my private blog.

As the subtitle already promises, the blog is a colorful hotchpotch. Here you can find things from my everyday life that might be interesting or helpful for other people.

I studied media and political science at the [University of Trier][1] and [Lancaster University][2]. Till the end of 2021 I worked as [a research assistant at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)][3], more precisely in the [Department of Science Communication at the Institute of Technology Futures][4]. Since then, I am employed at the President's Office at the [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/).

Before that, I worked at the University of Trier and headed the constituency office of a member of the Bundestag.

At KIT, I taught in the study program _[Science – Media – Communication][5]_ and did research in the project [&#8220;Science for All: How can science communication succeed with target groups not yet reached?&#8221;][6].

Furthermore, I was also involved in setting up the portal _[wissenschaftskommunikation.de][7]_ as editor for the research section.

In my spare time I play rugby. Currently, rather sporadically at [Karlsruher SV][8], in the past for [Rugby Trier][9], of which I also host and maintain the homepage.
