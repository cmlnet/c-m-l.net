summary: Responsible editor for the research section of the portal from 2016 to 2017.

From 2016 until the end of 2017 I worked as editor at [wissenschaftskommunikation.de](https://www.wissenschaftskommunikation.de/) and accompanied the development of the portal before I changed to the project [Science for all](/en/projects/science-for-all/).

I was mainly responsible for the section [Research](https://www.wissenschaftskommunikation.de/kategorie/forschung/). In this function I developed and established the format [News from Research](https://www.wissenschaftskommunikation.de/kategorie/forschung/forschungsrueckblick/) which still exists today.

The portal is aimed at actors from public relations – e.g. university press offices – and science, but also addresses topics at the interface to science journalism. Accordingly, the above-mentioned research review is intended to make the results of the *Science of Science Communication* accessible to practitioners, most of whom are not familiar with the subject.

At the end of 2020, I wrote another three research reviews together with [Lena Puttfarcken](https://lenaputtfarcken.de/), as a substitute:

- Brief introduction: News from research in September 2020](https://www.wissenschaftskommunikation.de/kurz-vorgestellt-neues-aus-der-forschung-im-september-2020-42491/)
- Brief introduction: News from research in October 2020](https://www.wissenschaftskommunikation.de/kurz-vorgestellt-neues-aus-der-forschung-im-oktober-2020-43253/)
- Brief introduction: News from research in November 2020 (not yet published)
